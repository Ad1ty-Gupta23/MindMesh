# === MEDITATION SUPPORT ===
I just finished a 10-minute meditation session|meditation_completed,xp_gained:50,streak:3|Great job completing your meditation! I can see you've maintained a 3-day streak - that consistency is building real mental strength. How are you feeling after this session? More centered?

I can't seem to focus during meditation|struggling_meditation,mood:frustrated|It's completely normal to have wandering thoughts during meditation. Your mind isn't broken - it's just doing what minds do! Try the "noting" technique: when thoughts arise, gently say "thinking" and return to your breath. Even noticing distraction IS mindfulness.

I keep falling asleep while meditating|meditation_difficulty,tired|Falling asleep during meditation often means your body really needs rest. Try meditating with your eyes slightly open, sitting upright, or choosing a more alert time of day. Your XP shows you're committed - let's find what works for your energy levels.

I've been meditating for 30 days straight|meditation_streak:30,high_achievement|Incredible dedication! 30 days of consistent practice is a major milestone. Your brain has likely developed new neural pathways for calm and focus. What changes have you noticed in your daily life since starting this journey?

# === MOOD TRACKING & EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ===
I'm feeling really anxious today|mood:anxious,emotional_distress|I notice you're feeling anxious right now. Anxiety can feel overwhelming, but you're safe in this moment. Try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique: name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste. Would you like to do a quick breathing exercise with me?

I've been sad for the past week|mood:sad,duration:week,concerning_pattern|I see you've been carrying sadness for a while now. That takes real strength to acknowledge. Sadness often has important messages for us. Have there been any specific events or thoughts contributing to these feelings? Remember, it's okay to not be okay.

I'm feeling stressed about work|mood:stressed,work_related|Work stress is so common, but that doesn't make it less valid. Your body and mind are signaling they need support. Let's break this down - is it workload, relationships, or uncertainty that's weighing on you? We can explore some stress-management techniques.

I had a panic attack earlier|mood:panic,crisis_past|I'm sorry you experienced a panic attack - those can be terrifying. First, you survived it, which shows your strength. Panic attacks feel dangerous but aren't physically harmful. Are you feeling safer now? Let's work on some grounding techniques for if this happens again.

I feel amazing today, so productive|mood:euphoric,high_energy|I love seeing you feeling energized and productive! It's beautiful when everything clicks. While you're feeling strong, this might be a perfect time to do some journaling or meditation to anchor these positive feelings for harder days ahead.

I don't know how I'm feeling|mood:confused,emotional_numbness|Sometimes emotions get so mixed up they're hard to name, and that's completely valid. Emotional confusion often happens when we're processing a lot. Try this: if your feelings were weather, what would the sky look like right now? Sometimes metaphors help us understand ourselves.

# === FOCUS & PRODUCTIVITY SUPPORT ===
I can't concentrate on anything today|focus_difficulty,distracted|Brain fog and difficulty concentrating happen to everyone. Your attention is like a muscle that gets tired. Have you been getting enough sleep, water, and movement? Sometimes our minds need basic care before they can focus. Want to try a 5-minute focus reset?

I completed a 2-hour deep work session|focus_achievement,productivity_high,xp_gained:100|Two hours of deep focus is incredible in our distraction-filled world! Your brain just got a serious workout. I see you earned 100 XP - well deserved. What helped you stay so focused? Let's bottle that magic for future sessions.

I keep getting distracted by my phone|distraction,phone_addiction|Phone distraction is one of the biggest challenges we face. Your brain gets little dopamine hits from notifications - it's designed to be addictive. Try putting your phone in another room or using focus mode. Your awareness of this pattern is already a huge step forward.

I've been procrastinating on an important project|procrastination,avoidance,stress|Procrastination often isn't about laziness - it's usually about fear, perfectionism, or feeling overwhelmed. What feels scary or difficult about starting this project? Sometimes breaking it into tiny 5-minute tasks makes it less intimidating.

# === SLEEP & ENERGY PATTERNS ===
I didn't sleep well last night|sleep_poor,tired|Poor sleep affects everything - mood, focus, emotional regulation. Your brain literally cleans itself during sleep, so feeling off after a bad night makes total sense. What might have disrupted your sleep? Let's think about tonight's sleep setup.

I've been having nightmares|sleep_disturbance,nightmares,anxiety|Nightmares can be really unsettling and affect your whole day. They often reflect stress or unprocessed emotions. Are there any patterns to when they happen? Creating a calming bedtime routine and addressing daytime stress can help reduce them.

I woke up feeling refreshed for once|sleep_good,energy_high,positive|What a wonderful way to start the day! Good sleep is like a reset button for your whole system. What did you do differently last night? Let's identify what supported this great sleep so we can repeat it.

# === JOURNALING & SELF-REFLECTION ===
I don't know what to write about|journaling_block,creativity_low|Writer's block happens even with personal journaling! Try these prompts: "Right now I'm feeling..." or "Something I'm grateful for is..." or "A challenge I'm facing is..." There's no wrong way to journal - even writing "I don't know what to write" is journaling!

I wrote about something really painful today|journaling_emotional,processing_trauma|It takes courage to write about painful experiences. Journaling can bring up intense emotions as you process - that's actually part of healing. How are you feeling now after getting those thoughts out? Remember to be gentle with yourself today.

I love writing in my journal|journaling_positive,self_reflection|Journaling is such a powerful tool for self-understanding! It's like having a conversation with your deepest self. I'm glad you've found this practice meaningful. What insights have surprised you the most about yourself through writing?

# === RELATIONSHIP & SOCIAL SUPPORT ===
I had a fight with my friend|relationship_conflict,social_stress|Conflict with friends can feel really heavy, especially when you care about them. Arguments often happen when both people have valid needs that seem to clash. Have you had time to process what the core issue was? Sometimes a little space helps before reconnecting.

I'm feeling lonely|loneliness,social_isolation|Loneliness is one of the most human experiences, but it can feel so isolating paradoxically. You're not alone in feeling alone. Is this about wanting more social connection, or feeling disconnected even around others? Both are valid and we can explore ways to address either.

I don't feel understood by anyone|isolation,misunderstood,communication|Feeling misunderstood can be so painful - like you're speaking a different language than everyone else. Often this happens when we're going through something unique or growing in new ways. You're understood here. What would feeling truly understood look like to you?

# === PERSONAL GROWTH & ACHIEVEMENTS ===
I reached level 5 in the app today|achievement,gamification,progress,xp_milestone|Level 5! That represents real commitment to your mental health journey. Each level shows you're building consistent habits that support your wellbeing. What's been the most helpful feature for you so far? How do you feel about your progress?

I've been using MindMesh for 3 months now|long_term_user,commitment,growth|Three months of consistent self-care - that's incredible dedication! You've likely developed some real mental fitness by now. Looking back, what changes have you noticed in how you handle stress, emotions, or daily challenges?

I completed all my daily quests|daily_goals_complete,high_motivation,routine|Perfect day! Completing all your daily quests shows real commitment to your mental health. Your future self will thank you for this consistency. What felt easiest today, and what required more effort?

# === CRISIS SUPPORT & SAFETY ===
I'm having thoughts of hurting myself|crisis,self_harm_ideation,emergency|I'm really concerned about you and I want you to stay safe. These thoughts are a sign you're in serious pain, not that you're broken. Please reach out to a crisis helpline: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 988, or go to your nearest emergency room. You matter and help is available. Can you think of one person you could call right now?

Everything feels hopeless|depression,hopelessness,despair|When everything feels hopeless, it means you're carrying enormous pain. Hopelessness is a symptom, not a fact - even though it feels absolutely real right now. You reached out here, which shows part of you is still fighting. That part of you is wise. Have you been able to eat or sleep today?

I don't see the point in anything|depression,existential_crisis,meaning|When nothing feels meaningful, it's often because depression has dimmed your ability to feel connection and purpose. This isn't permanent, even though it feels infinite. Small actions - even opening this app - can be acts of hope. What used to bring you even tiny moments of peace?

# === GENERAL WELLNESS & LIFESTYLE ===
I've been eating better lately|nutrition,self_care,positive_habit|Taking care of your nutrition is such an act of self-love! Food literally fuels your brain and affects your mood. What changes have you made? I bet your energy levels and mental clarity are thanking you.

I haven't been exercising much|fitness_low,sedentary,guilt|Movement and mental health are so connected, but please don't beat yourself up. Sometimes life gets overwhelming and exercise feels impossible. Even 5 minutes of stretching or walking counts. What kind of movement used to bring you joy?

I'm trying to drink more water|hydration,health_habits,small_changes|Hydration affects everything - your mood, energy, even anxiety levels! It's such an underestimated part of mental wellness. Are you noticing any changes in how you feel? Sometimes the simple changes make the biggest difference.

# === WORK-LIFE BALANCE ===
I'm burning out at work|burnout,work_stress,exhaustion|Burnout is your body and mind's way of saying "this pace isn't sustainable." It's not a personal failing - it's a normal response to chronic stress. What boundaries could you set, even small ones? Sometimes protecting your energy becomes the most important work you can do.

I can't stop thinking about work|work_obsession,boundary_issues,anxiety|When work thoughts invade your personal time, your nervous system can't properly rest and recharge. This creates anxiety and prevents real recovery. Have you tried creating a "transition ritual" between work and personal time? Even 10 minutes can help your brain shift gears.

# === SEASONAL & ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ===
I always feel worse in winter|seasonal_depression,SAD,environmental|Seasonal changes affect many people's mental health - you're not imagining it! Reduced sunlight can literally change your brain chemistry. Light therapy, vitamin D, maintaining routines, and extra self-compassion during darker months can all help. How many more weeks of winter do you have?

The weather is beautiful today|positive_mood,environmental_boost,gratitude|Beautiful weather can be such a mood lifter! There's real science behind how sunlight and fresh air affect our wellbeing. Are you able to get outside and soak some of it in? Even opening windows can help bring that energy inside.

# === HABIT FORMATION & ROUTINE ===
I'm struggling to build new habits|habit_formation,motivation_low,consistency|Building new habits is genuinely hard - your brain prefers familiar patterns. Start incredibly small: instead of "meditate 20 minutes," try "sit quietly for 2 minutes." Success breeds success. What's one tiny version of the habit you want to build?

I broke my meditation streak|streak_broken,disappointment,perfectionism|Streaks are motivating, but they can also create pressure that works against us. Missing one day doesn't erase all your progress - you've still built the neural pathways and skills. Streaks are tools, not masters. Ready to start a new one tomorrow?

# === CREATIVITY & EXPRESSION ===
I'm feeling creatively blocked|creativity_block,artistic_struggle,frustration|Creative blocks often happen when we're putting too much pressure on ourselves or when other parts of life are consuming our mental energy. Creativity needs space to breathe. Sometimes the best thing is to play without expecting anything good to come out. What used to make you feel creative and free?

I made something I'm proud of today|creative_achievement,accomplishment,joy|Creating something you're proud of is such a special feeling! Whether it's art, writing, music, or even a good meal - you brought something new into the world. That creative energy is part of what makes you uniquely you. What inspired this creation?

# === MINDFULNESS & PRESENCE ===
I keep living in the past|rumination,regret,stuck|Minds naturally drift to the past, especially when there are unresolved feelings there. The past holds lessons, but living there robs us of the present moment where life actually happens. What would it look like to honor the past while staying grounded in now?

I'm always worried about the future|anxiety,future_focus,catastrophizing|Future-focused anxiety is so common - your brain is trying to prepare for threats that may never come. While some planning is helpful, excessive future worry steals joy from today. What if we practiced bringing your attention back to this moment, right now?

# === SELF-COMPASSION & INNER CRITIC ===
I'm being really hard on myself today|self_criticism,inner_critic,harsh|That inner critic can be brutal, can't it? Often we speak to ourselves in ways we'd never speak to a friend. What would you say to someone you cared about who was going through exactly what you're experiencing? You deserve that same kindness from yourself.

I'm proud of how I handled something difficult|self_appreciation,growth,resilience|It's so important to acknowledge when we handle challenges well! This kind of self-recognition builds confidence and resilience. Your ability to recognize your own growth shows real emotional maturity. What helped you navigate that difficult situation?

# === LIFE TRANSITIONS & CHANGE ===
Everything in my life is changing|life_transition,uncertainty,overwhelm|Big life changes can feel like emotional whiplash, even when they're positive changes. Your brain likes predictability, so transition periods can trigger anxiety even when you're moving toward good things. What feels most uncertain right now? Sometimes naming the specific fears helps.

I don't know what I want anymore|identity_crisis,confusion,lost|Periods of not knowing what we want often come during growth phases - the old version of you is shifting, but the new version isn't fully formed yet. This in-between space is uncomfortable but often very creative. What did you want before that doesn't fit anymore?

# === GRATITUDE & POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY ===
I'm having trouble feeling grateful|gratitude_difficulty,depression,negativity_bias|When you're struggling, gratitude can feel forced or fake - and that's okay. You don't need to feel grateful for suffering. Sometimes we start smaller: "I'm grateful my heart kept beating today" or "I'm grateful for this warm cup of coffee." What's one tiny thing that didn't make your day worse?

I feel grateful for so many things today|gratitude,positive_mood,appreciation|Gratitude is like sunshine for the soul! When we can genuinely appreciate what we have, it shifts our whole perspective. This grateful energy you're feeling - it's actually changing your brain chemistry for the better. What sparked this grateful feeling today?

# === BOUNDARIES & SAYING NO ===
I have trouble saying no to people|boundaries,people_pleasing,overwhelm|Learning to say no is one of the hardest but most important life skills. People-pleasing often comes from fear of rejection or conflict, but saying yes when you mean no ultimately hurts both you and your relationships. What makes saying no feel so scary or difficult?

I set a boundary today and it felt scary|boundary_setting,growth,courage|Setting boundaries takes real courage, especially the first few times! That scared feeling is normal - you're doing something your people-pleasing self isn't used to. How did the other person respond? Remember, their reaction isn't your responsibility.

# === TECHNOLOGY & DIGITAL WELLNESS ===
I spend too much time on social media|digital_addiction,comparison,time_management|Social media can be a real mental health trap - endless comparison, dopamine hits, and time disappearing. Your awareness of this pattern is the first step. What do you think you're seeking when you scroll? Connection? Distraction? Validation? Understanding the "why" helps find healthier alternatives.

# === BODY IMAGE & SELF-ACCEPTANCE ===
I don't like how I look today|body_image,self_esteem,appearance|Body image can fluctuate so much day to day, and it's often more about our internal state than our actual appearance. Your worth isn't determined by how you look. What would it feel like to speak to your body with appreciation for what it does rather than criticism for how it appears?

# === PERFECTIONISM & EXPECTATIONS ===
Nothing I do feels good enough|perfectionism,self_criticism,high_standards|Perfectionism can be exhausting - like running a race where the finish line keeps moving. Often perfectionism is really fear wearing a fancy mask. What would "good enough" look like? Sometimes good enough is actually perfect for the situation.

I made a mistake and I can't stop thinking about it|rumination,shame,perfectionism|Mistakes feel so big when we're stuck in them, but they're actually how we learn and grow. What would you tell a friend who made the same mistake? That compassionate voice deserves to be turned inward too. Mistakes don't define us - how we respond to them does.

# === ENERGY MANAGEMENT ===
I have no energy for anything today|fatigue,low_energy,overwhelm|Low energy days are real and valid. Sometimes our bodies and minds need rest more than productivity. What would it look like to be gentle with yourself today? Even small acts of self-care count. What's the most basic thing you need right now - food, water, rest, or comfort?

I feel energized and ready to tackle my goals|high_energy,motivation,momentum|High energy days are gifts! This motivated feeling is wonderful, and also remember to pace yourself. Sometimes when we feel great, we overcommit and burn out later. How can you channel this energy in a sustainable way? What matters most to you right now?
